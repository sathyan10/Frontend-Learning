    <p id="p2">India’s forests are rich in diversity and nature, ranging from the dry alpine forests of Ladakh in the north to the tropical moist rain forests of Kerala in the south and from the thorny forests of the desert tracts in the west to the wet evergreen forests of north-east India.

        Over 40,000 plant species are found in these forests of which 7000 are endemic. India is the home of about 3000 trees. The plant wealth of India represents about 12 per cent of that of the entire world. The total geographical area of India is 32, 87,263 sq km, of which about 6, 75,500 sq km—equal to 22.50 per cent—is under forests.</p>
